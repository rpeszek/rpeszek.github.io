        <p>I used to blog here: <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/">Opinions and Programming</a>.</p>
<p>My most read blogs were the <em>I don’t like Hibernate and Grails</em> series. It presented some lessons learned from using Grails in anger. Here are the direct links: the series started with <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/2014/08/i-dont-like-hibernate-and-grails-part-1.html">Part 1</a> and ended with <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/2014/10/i-dont-like-hibernategrails-part-11_31.html">Part 11</a>. This series topped the list of most read Groovy language blogs (according to <a href="groovyblogs.org">groovyblogs.org</a>) for several months back in 2014.</p>
<p><em>Opinions and Programming</em> site commemorates my programming journey and my fascination with functional programming. Includes my old posts about <a href="https://github.com/rpeszek/fpiglet"><em>figlet</em></a> (functional programming library I wrote for Groovy) staring from <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/2013/06/making-groovy-more-functional-fpiglet.html">this old post</a> to <a href="rpeszek.blogspot.com/2013/08/monadic-comprehensions-in-groovy-and.html">Monadic Comprehensions in Groovy/Fpiglet</a>. Functional programming never caught on in Groovy, <em>fpiglet</em> was one of the first attempts. I also done functional side trips like a <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/2013/10/functional-groovy-y-combinator-learning.html">Groovy take on Y-combinator</a>.</p>
<p>More recent blogs were more and more focused on Haskell. I have stopped contributing to this blog in 2017. There are many excellent Haskell blogs out there already.</p>
<p>Looking at stats for these blogs was a very interesting exercise. The stats for FP posts were very poor. The difference in number of views between my posts related to mainstream Groovy/Grails and my posts related to functional programming was 10X or bigger. Functional programming remains a niche part within the programming profession. Any estimates I have seen about mainstream vs functional programming jobs show FP to be less than 1% of job market. I believe spamming bots and accidental hits were the reasons why I have seen only a 10X reduction in number of viewer visits. Whatever the actual stats were, the small viewership contributed to my decision to stop blogging.</p>
<p>Playing with code is so much more fun that writing about it. But I still settled on a hybrid. I switched to literate Haskell programs and deployed these as <em>wiki</em> pages on my github projects:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rpeszek/notes-milewski-ctfp-hs/wiki">Milewski’s Category Theory for Programmers notes</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rpeszek/notes-milewski-ctfp-hs/wiki">Idris TTD book notes</a>.<br />
These seemed better than blog to me. The wiki introduction to my CTFP notes ended up copied on the old blog site <a href="http://rpeszek.blogspot.com/2018/02/">Why read CPFP?</a> but it was just a pandoc copy of the corresponding wiki page.</p>
<p>I still have occasional need to vent my technical thoughts and concerns. For this reason I decided to move my blog here, closer to my github pet projects.</p>
